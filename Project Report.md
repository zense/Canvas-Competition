# Project Name: NewGalaxy

# Team Name: BRUTE BYTE FORCE

## Mission:
Your Planet, "Omega" is in danger. Alien species from Planet "Beta" has sent laser shooters in the several orbits around your Planet.
To protect your Planet, you have been assigned to destroy the laser shooters ASAP! You are given a Defence Capsule that can withstand all kinds of damages which must be used to crash into these laser shooters. The orbits for the Defence Capsule are already assigned, control the Defence Capsule and save your Planet Omega before it is too late(Yeah! you are time bound.)

## Instructions:
The Defence Capsule can only move in clockwise rotation and can only be launched tangentially into the next orbit but not back. This means you have only one-shot at destroying a specific laser shooter (or maybe you could finesse the few missed laser shooters). Be cautious to not make a mistake. Your Planet's fate rests in your hands.

## Controls:
1) To move Defence Capsule around an orbit: "ArrowUp" key
2) To launch Defence Capsule into next orbit: "Z" key

# Project Report:
These are few challenges we faced while implementing our idea:-

1) Using Polar coordinates for movement of objects
2) Animating objects using Javascript

*Thanks to this amazing hackathon, it was fun to implement coordinate geometry outside maths notebooks, and Javascript is indeed powerful and fun; got a good start for further developments*
