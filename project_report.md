#  Interactive Simulations
## Team - Lords of the Bits

A Physics Simulator based on Canvas.
It includes 2 different simulators:-

## 1 - Convex Lens Simulator

* Press 1 to switch to the Convex Lens Simulator
* Mouse position = position of object
* Press Left Arrow / Right Arrow Key to set the focal length of the lens

## 2 - A OddlySatisfying Pattern Simulator

* Press 2 to switch to the Pattern Simulator
* Press and hold Left Mouse Button to start drawing the pattern and having fun ;)
* Press Left Arrow / Right Arrow Key to set the number of axes of the pattern
* Press Up Arrow / Down Arrow Key to set the thickness of lines
* Press B to change to Black Mode (details are more clearly visible on black mode)

## System Requirements
Any latest updated web browser will work.

***IMPORTANT*** - View the project in maximised window of browser for best experience.

## Aim
* To have fun.
* Learn how to code complex ideas in limited time, thereby developing a long coding sitting habit.
* Learning a new language (Javascript)

## What I learned?

Learning Javascript for the first time and working with HTML was a challenge for sure but I now know that adopting to new programming languages after learning any one is not that big a task ;)

## Future scope

This project covered the basics of making a Physics simulator. Understanding this project will enable us to make any other Optics related simulator relatively easily.
