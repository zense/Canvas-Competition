## Angry Pigs Game

### Idea of project:
To make a game of Angry birds but with the concept of pigs instead, trying to drop the eggs.

### Implementation:
The project is tried to be implemented using the canvas html5 tool with predefined functions given.
- A game of two players, where the objective is for the player's pig to drop the other players egg.
- The game consists of blocks in the way which will fall (without rotation).
- The eggs will also fall (without rotation).

### Problems:
- Partners weren't available together at all times, so there were extra time restrictions.
- There was flickering issue in the images used which could not be overcome even with the double buffering function.
- The syntax of html5 wasn't very clear so it was hard to implement the functions created.

### What we learnt:
- We need to learn better time management.
- Learnt about the usefulness of the canvas tool in html5.
- Learnt a bit about the javascript syntax.
