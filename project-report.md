# DESCRIPTION
Our project uses a technique known as 'ray-tracing,' to render 3-dimensional video games.
Rays that imitiate light (can be thought of as reversed light rays) are shot from a point (behaviour of an eye) to a window that represents the screen.
These rays return the combined pixel data of surfaces they collide with.

# WHAT IT DOES
The user can add any number of spheres or sources of light (objects) along with their properties while they are being 3D rendered.
They can look around and move forward using the arrow keys, and delete these objects as and when they wish.

# CONTROLS
'a' to add objects\
'd' to delete objects\
Left Arrow Key to turn left\
Right Arrow Key to turn right\
Up Arrow Key to move forward.

# HOW IT WAS BUILT
We used 'canvas.js,' a framework provided by Zense for controls and writing pixel data.
We created 'Vector' and 'Ray' classes that easened 3-dimensional mathematics.
We created 'Ball', 'Camera' and 'Light' classes to represent the objects.

# CHALLENGES
Debugging proved to be much harder than writing the code itself. 

# INSPIRATION
We drew inspiration from a youtube video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkETiyYWh2o) where ray-tracing was done on the console using ASCII.
